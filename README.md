## 📚 About This Project

This project was developed by following a **comprehensive tutorial** that explained everything step-by-step.  
Some parts were **very challenging**, especially the logic for **user sessions**, **form handling**, and **updating user credentials** like username, email, and age.

Despite the difficulties, it was a great opportunity to **improve my PHP and MySQL skills**, and to better understand how **front-end and back-end** work together in a secure and functional authentication system.
